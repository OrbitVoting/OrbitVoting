Welcome to the votecount bot.

To try it out for yourself, you have two options:

1) If you're familiar with some programming and interested in getting a behind-the-scenes look, download the contents of the actual repository, and run the code using the python interpreter. There are quite a few steps involved before that, so chat with me and I'll run you through it.

2) End user trying to use it? It's simple: go to "releases" and download the latest version (Windows only for now - mac expected soon). Run the "app.exe" file and follow the instructions. The settings are pre-loaded for now; i.e. it connects to my spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VXNu_zrOsuoRPmF72ldW_A17xlu3r3XyFaRsLd_O8HY/edit?usp=sharing) and takes info from there. Feel free to connect your own spreadsheet (the settings option tells you how) based off of the above spreadsheet; just delete the contents and reset the active column to 2. 

**Note: the spreadsheet ID is not the URL; rather, it's the the code that coes after the /d/ bit until the /edit bit. In the above one, it's 1VXNu_zrOsuoRPmF72ldW_A17xlu3r3XyFaRsLd_O8HY

I'll add a feature later where you can just paste the URLs in, but that's for later.
